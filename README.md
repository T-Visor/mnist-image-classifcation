# mnist-image-classification
A basic CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which can classify handwritten digits from
the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset.

This work extends on code provided at
https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-for-mnist-handwritten-digit-classification/

Run the 'create-digit-classifier.py' file to create a classification model and save it to disk. Then run the 'make-prediction.py' file to classify a sample image.
